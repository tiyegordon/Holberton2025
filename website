        <h2>Empowering Change: Making an Impact in My Community</h2>
        <p>
            An impactful opportunity in my community is bridging the gap in technology through representation and advocacy for women of color.
        </p>

            <p>
                Despite the growing demand for tech talent, women of color remain underrepresented in fields like DevOps and software engineering. 
                To address this, I am committed to advocating for diversity through initiatives like workshops and boot camps.
            </p>

            <p>
                By fostering an inclusive environment and increasing representation, I can inspire the next generation of women in tech, 
                providing them with the tools and support needed to thrive and create a more equitable future in technology.

            <h3>My DevOps Journey Blog</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            In August 2025, I began a blog to document the projects I’ve worked on, with a focus on Cloud Engineering, AI, and Automation.
            These projects span cloud environments like Azure and AWS and utilize technologies such as Docker, Containers, Python, and Infrastructure as Code.
            I’ve really enjoyed contributing to the DevOps community through this blog.
            As I continue my journey at Holberton Coding School, I'm excited to expand both my knowledge and the blog's content.

        <h2>Looking Towards the Future</h2>
        <p>
            My goal is to become a highly skilled DevOps Engineer, specializing in automation, cloud technologies, and infrastructure as code (IaC) 
            to optimize software development and deployment processes.
        </p>

        <div>
            <h3>Short-Term Goals: 100 Days</h3>
            <p>
                In the short term, before my enrollment in the Holberton June 1, 2025 cohort, I will focus on earning industry-recognized certifications 
                such as the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Terraform Associate (HashiCorp). Additionally, I will continue gaining hands-on experience 
                with CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud automation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Long-Term Goals: 3-5 Years</h3>
            <p>
                Over the next 3-5 years, I aim to advance into a Senior DevOps Engineer position, specializing in cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) and 
                automation tools to increase efficiency and scalability. As I grow in my career, I will develop consulting expertise and begin offering 
                freelance DevOps services, eventually launching my own DevOps consulting agency or cloud solutions business.
            </p>
            <p>
                My long-term vision is to achieve financial freedom by leveraging my DevOps career to build multiple income streams, including high-paying 
                full-time roles, consulting, and tech-related investments such as real estate, stocks, or SaaS businesses. By combining technical expertise, 
                leadership, and entrepreneurship, I will create a sustainable, high-income career while building long-term wealth and impact in the tech industry.
